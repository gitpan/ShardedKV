Take the mysql-DSN related file from this directory, adapt it to your
mysql test database/host, and put it in the distribution main directory
to run the mysql-related tests.

WARNING: The mysql tests (if set up using the above) will create tables,
         stuff data in them, and NOT CLEAN UP AFTER THEM!
         That's a TODO, but for the time being, since this is an author
         test, clean up after yourself.

For testing the Redis storage, cp the redis "config" file into the
distribution main directory, modify it to point at your TEST server,
make sure it has at least ~10 databases configured.
The Redis storage tests might also not clean up properly, but they
*should* set expiration to ~30 seconds.
