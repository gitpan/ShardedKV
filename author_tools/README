Take the mysql-DSN related file from this directory, adapt it to your
mysql test database/host, and put it in the distribution main directory
to run the mysql-related tests.

WARNING: The mysql tests (if set up using the above) will create tables,
         stuff data in them, and NOT CLEAN UP AFTER THEM!
         That's a TODO, but for the time being, since this is an author
         test, clean up after yourself.
