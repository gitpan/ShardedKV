=head1 NAME

ShardedKV::Storage::Redis - Abstract base class for storing k/v pairs in Redis

=head1 VERSION

version 0.19

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # use a subclass instead

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class consumes the L<ShardedKV::Storage> role. It is an abstract base
class for storing key-value pairs in Redis. It does not actually implement
the C<get()> and C<set()> methods and does not impose a Redis value type.
Different subclasses of this class are expected to represent different
storages for distinct Redis value types.

=head1 PUBLIC ATTRIBUTES

=head2 redis_connect_str

A hostname:port string pointing at the Redis for this shard.
Required.

=head2 redis_retry_every

The amount of time the C<Redis> object should wait between reconnect attempts, in milliseconds.  Default 500.

=head2 redis_reconnect_timeout

If set, the amount of time the C<Redis> object should try reconnecting for, in seconds.  If 0, do not attempt to reconnect.

=head2 redis

The C<Redis> object that represents the connection. Will be generated from the
C<redis_connect_str> attribute and may be reset/reconnected at any time.

=head2 expiration_time

Base key expiration time to use in seconds.
Defaults to undef / not expiring at all.

=head2 expiration_time_jitter

Additional random jitter to add to the expiration time.
Defaults to 0. Don't set to undef to disable, set to 0
to disable.

=head2 database_number

Indicates the number of the Redis database to use for this shard.
If undef/non-existant, no specific database will be selected,
so the Redis server will use the default.

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

=head2 delete

Implemented in the base class, this method deletes the given key from the Redis shard.

=head2 get

Not implemented in the base class. This method is supposed to fetch a value
back from Redis. Beware: Depending on the C<ShardedKV::Storage::Redis> subclass,
the reference type that this method returns may vary. For example, if you use
C<ShardedKV::Storage::Redis::String>, the return value will be a scalar reference
to a string. For C<ShardedKV::String::Redis::Hash>, the return value is
unsurprisingly a hash reference.

=head2 set

The counterpart to C<get>. Expects values as second argument. The value must
be of the same reference type that is returned by C<get()>.
