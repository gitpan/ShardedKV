=head1 NAME

ShardedKV::Storage::MySQL - MySQL storage backend for ShardedKV

=head1 VERSION

version 0.14

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ShardedKV;
  use ShardedKV::Storage::MySQL;
  ... create ShardedKV...
  my $storage = ShardedKV::Storage::MySQL->new(
  );
  ... put storage into ShardedKV...
  
  # values are array references
  $skv->set("foo", ["bar"]);
  my $value_ref = $skv->get("foo");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A C<ShardedKV> storage backend that C<DBI> and C<DBD::mysql> to
store data in a MySQL table.

Implements the C<ShardedKV::Storage> role.

Each shard (== C<ShardedKV::Storage::MySQL> object) is represented by a
single table in some schema on some database server.

=head1 PUBLIC ATTRIBUTES

=head2 mysql_connector

A callback that must be supplied at object creation time. The storage
object will invoke the callback whenever it needs to get a NEW mysql
database handle. This means when:

  - first connecting
  - "MySQL server has gone away" => reconnect

The callback allows users to hook into the connection logic to implement
things such as connection caching. If you do use connection caching, then
do assert that the dbh is alive (eg. using C<$dbh-E<gt>ping()> before
returning a cached connection.

=head2 mysql_endpoint

A callback that should return a unique string that represents the endpoint. In
most cases this should be a hostname to allow for debugging connection issues.

The callback allows users to hook into the connection logic and update the
string that represents the particular endpoint that this storage instance
represents.

=head2 mysql_connection

This is the public attribute holding a MySQL database handle (which was
created using the C<mysql_connector>). Do not supply this at object
creation.

=head2 table_name

The name of the table that represents this shard.
Must be supplied at object creation.

=head2 key_col_name

The name of the column to be used for the key.
If C<ShardedKV::Storage::MySQL> creates the shard table for you, then
this column is also used as the primary key unless
C<auto_increment_col_name> is set (see below).

There can only be one key column.

Defaults to 'keystr'.

=head2 key_col_type

The MySQL type of the key column.

Defaults to 'VARBINARY(16) NOT NULL'.

=head2 auto_increment_col_name

The name of the column to be used for the auto-increment pimrary key.
This is a virtually unused (by ShardedKV) column that, IF DEFINED, will
be used as an auto-increment primary key. It is not the column used to
fetch rows by, but rather facilitates faster insertion of new records
by allowing append instead of insertion at random order within the PK
tree.

If C<ShardedKV::Storage::MySQL> creates the shard table for you, then
this column is also used as the primary key.

There can only be one auto-increment key column.

Defaults to 'id'.

=head2 auto_increment_col_type

The MySQL type of the auto increment column.

Defaults to 'BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT'.

=head2 value_col_names

An array reference containing the names of all value columns in
the shard table. Needs to contain at least one value column.

Defaults to C<[qw(val last_change)]>.

=head2 value_col_types

An array reference containing the MySQL types of each value column
given in C<value_col_names>.

Defaults to: C<['MEDIUMBLOB NOT NULL', 'TIMESTAMP NOT NULL']>.

=head2 extra_indexes

A string that is included verbatim after the PRIMARY KEY line of the
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS statement that this class generates. This can be
used to add additional indexes to the shard tables, such as indexes on the
last modification (for expiration from the database, not handled by ShardedKV).

=head2 max_num_reconnect_attempts

The maximum number of reconnect attempts that the storage object
should perform if the MySQL server has gone away.
Reconnects are done with exponential back-off (see below).

Defaults to 5.

=head2 reconnect_interval

The base interval for reconnection attempts. Do note that
exponential reconnect back-off is used, so if the base reconnect_interval
is 1 second, then the first reconnect attempt is done immediately,
the second after one second, the third after two seconds, the fourth
after four seconds, and so on.

Default: 1 second

Can also be fractional seconds.

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

=head2 prepare_table

This method will generate a C<CREATE TABLE> statement from the
various properties of the storage object and execute it on the MySQL
server to prepare the shard table.

=head2 refresh_connection

Explicitly drops the MySQL connection object and calls back into
the provided connect handler to get a new connection.
